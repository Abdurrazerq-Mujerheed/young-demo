        <p>The Young Democrats Movement is a Political Movement that has been created by the realistic Student Of Politics, BASHÄªR ALAAYA, in the year 2020, 
          with the chief aim of indoctrinating the Youth into Politics and its activities. Driven by a felt imperative to rescue our glorious fatherland from the hands of the
          unscrupulous political prostitutes, administrative vampires, executive sabre-toothed tigers  and their girlfriends, he has taken it upon himself to remind 
          the Youth that there's a lot at stake in this fast approaching 2023 Electioneering race.</p>
        
        <p>As we are inevitably heading towards 2023, The long awaited Electioneering Year, The Chairman/founder, 
          together with the brilliant Prime-movers of the Movement figured it out that for the movement to proudly achieve its aim, 
          she needs to be expanded beyond regional space and should be a formidable Movement that is nationally infectious, in other Words, Nationwide Movement. </p>
        
        <p>Thus, the raison d'etre for the creation of Her " Sister Bodies" across Higher Institutions of learning in many States of the federation.</p>
        
        <p>Furthermore, since it is undoubtedly true that in a UNIVERSITY environment, the talents and creative energies of the educated Youth can be easily unleashed, there 
          must be commitment by the Movement to carrying these Youth along in order for them to have the unique opportunity to Renaissance their blessed Society which at 
          present is Jumbled, Timid and confused.</p>
        
        <p>Proud Democrats, it is up to us to either fold our arms and say that Nigeria is beyond saving or we can take the bull by the horns with an optimism that 
          Nigeria is worth saving and trusting that better days lay ahead after these turbulent years we are all experiencing which is deleterious to our cohesive 
          existence as a sovereign state especially at this critical time of our national history.</p>
        
        <p>Remember, if we stand aloof, and we don't rely on our own efforts, plans and modalities on how to save ourselves from the uneviable state we found 
          ourselves and leave God to do His will, the Almighty God will always do His best.</p>

        <p>But when we have done what we should do for our country to the best of our ability, we should rest assured that the true one God will take care 
          of the rest better than we can ever imagine! With your contribution and commitment, felicity is assured.</p>

        <p>God bless you and the Young Democrats Movement  and may God continue to bless the Federal Republic of Nigeria.</p>

        <h2>VISION</h2>
        <p>It is her vision to bring together an eclectic group of old and upcoming politicians, progressive and radicals, Intellectuals, educated and 
          the semi-educated ones including sycophants, Muslims and Christians, Southerners and Northerners and rich and poor. The Young Democrats 
          Movement is federally charactered and doesn't discriminate. And that is one of the beautiful things to know about it.</p>

        <p>Largely, it is her vision to mobilize and have active Democrats from across the nook and cranny of Nigeria indoctrinated into Political participation.</p>

        <p>It is her vision to register over 500,000 Five Hundred Thousand electorate in Nigeria who will use their PVCS to save themselves and the country 
          from further harrowing experiences ultimately by kicking the rascals out of the corridor, kitchen and indeed bedroom of power.</p>

        <p>It is the Young Democrats Movement vision to arrive at no less than 1 Million Democrats who will pledge allegiance to Atiku Abubakar and 
          his Presidential bid. She's in voracious search for a Million Young Democrats who will stand with this public servant through thick and 
          thin till he's the next occupant of Asorock.</p>  

        <p>It is her vision to bring under its wing, visionary Democrats, who will be able to sieve out a committed man for the Top job of 
          Presidency from the fake ones who disguise as Democrats.</p>

        <p>It is her dream to bring in proud Democrats who will support the valiant crusade in our nation's restructuring in 2023 which needs 
          to be grounded more on sound activism and plans and less on juvenile sloganeering and political hoodwink.</p>

        <h2>POWER OF THE MOVEMENT</h2>
        <p>The Young Democrats Movement is a sine qua non asset to any Political Party in Nigeria seeking to emerge victorious in the upcoming 
          Gubernatorial and Presidential Elections. The irrefutable evidence is on ground. Notable politicians have in past few months 
          approached the movement to curry her favour but were only given hope and not satisfaction. We do not want leaders with rhetorics 
          in their canvass only to become ravenous looters when they grab the mantle of leadership.</p>
        
        <p>After watching, reaching out to, studying, talking to, and listening to reasonable Nigerians as to who is needed as President to 
          deliver us, The Movement came to a number of conclusions that mark Atiku Abubakar as a man of adequate intelligence to run the 
          affairs of this country with his broad vision, confidence, experience, understanding, sense of security, character and passion 
          to move the nation forward on a fast trajectory...</p>

        <p>REASON: Atiku Abubakar's career in the public service and his participation in the struggle for the restoration of democratic rule in 
          Nigeria have afforded him the unique opportunity to interact with the diverse people of this country and to gain a lot of insight into 
          what is needed to keep it united and strong.</p>

        <p>More importantly, during his eight (8) years as the Vice President of this country, he has been privileged to have participated in and he 
          made his modest contribution to the formulation of our various socio-economic policies to which he was genuinely committed because they were 
          in entire consonance with his disposition as a result of the managerial experience he has acquired in the Public and Private sector of the economy.</p>

        <p>For these and many other qualities which time and space will not permit us to fully articulate, the YDM settled for Atiku Abubakar.</p>

        <h3>A Succinct Reminder About The Unsavory Situation We Found Ourselves In As Citizens.</h3>
        <p>There is no iota of doubt at all that every conscientious  Nigerian is looking forward to 2023 as far as the future of Nigeria is concerned, with 
          the hope of planning and praying for the best President to take us forward where the incumbent Head of State would have left us on 29th May, 2023, 
          so that everyone of us sees the PROMISED LAND.</p>
        
        <p>I'm very very confident that my reader will agree with me that the "Giant of Africa"  is under the most heinous challenges in Her History as a 
          sovereign State. Our country is in deep economic crisis owing to direct state involvement in all spheres of economic activities, spiralling 
          corruption and malversation, aphasic inefficiency, and an unbelievable debt profile.</p>

        <p>The physical infrastructures are in a state of fissiparous negligence and the security of persons and property as enshrined under sections 33 
          and 43 of the 1999 Constitution are not guaranteed.</p>

        <p>Poverty is the main commodity of our Independence as most of the citizens are groping with life threatening situation. Affordable healthcare 
          delivery system is out of the reach of the common man as well as other essentials of life.</p>
        
        <p>In addition, 79 Months equivalent to (six (6) and a half Year) of the APC rudderless administration, is breeding a culture of arbitrariness, 
          flagrant abuse of human rights and horrendous disregard for the rule of law, all of which is demoting us to the uneviable league of pariah as 
          a state in the group of serious nations.</p>

        <p>But is that the end of the road for Nigeria? It is not and should not be if we do the right thing. We will not wait till "2023" before we 
          start enlightening the Nigerian electorate on what needs be done to have a radical change in the entire edifice of our political management.</p>

        <p>Indeed, 2023, is a Clarion call on us  all as concerned Nigerians, to saddle for the optimum criterion in effecting a necessary change, in the choice of those who lead us.</p>

        <p>Truly, there's a big lapse in operation that kept the nation in suspended animation and at the prostrate for donkey years that made it a contraption and museum of the world. 
          The greatest threat to the country as of today is as a result of the inaction of those who should serve and save it.</p>

        <p>The struggle to reinvent Nigeria requires many hands pushing together. Please join us in making the goal come to fulfillment.</p>
