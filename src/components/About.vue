      <h2>WHAT EVERY DEMOCRAT SHOULD BE DEMANDING IN THE 2023 GENERAL ELECTIONS.</h2>
      <p>For the 2023 elections, it is my rights, it is your rights, it is our rights to demand the following;</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Good governance,</li>
        <li>Aministrative descency,</li>
        <li>Full food security,</li>
        <li>Life and property security,</li>
        <li>Political liberation from the Jackboots,</li>
        <li>Justice for everyone so that they all have a sense of belonging,</li>
        <li>Innovation,</li>
        <li>Clean energy to meet the moment on global warming,</li>
        <li>Massive job employment that will give an economic base to get started on,</li>
        <li>Production and Productivity,</li>
        <li>Expansion of and access to market,</li>
        <li>Affordable healthcare delivery system,</li>

      <p>A sovereign State like Nigeria guarantees all citizens, human, economic, social, civil and political rights. 
        And, we believe the Merciful Statesman, His Excellency, Dr. Atiku Abubakar, G.C.O.N, is going to make sure we all get that.</p>
      
      <p>By God who created me, we haven't been getting that in the last seven (7) Years!
